\begin{abstract}
With the Ontario government taking notable steps to increase
graduate enrolment through various initiatives, it is imperative that there exists an efficient
solution to track program milestones of graduate students and streamline the administrative
process to support the increased enrolment. More importantly, various privacy and security constraints
mandated by the University and Federal statutes also require consideration. Our project aims to meet the policies
mandated by FIPPA and UWO IT. Currently, developing customized Enterprise resource planning (ERP) can be expensive both in cost 
and time. This can be a problem if a department wishes to have complete control in their ERP option. Our prototype is a flexible web application 
system designed for the department of Medical Biophysics (MSc). The ERP was made
to track important dates from inception to completion of the program lifecycle and help manage
student information on an efficient basis. Due to the modular nature of the system, it can be
customized to suit other graduate programs at Western with minimal downtime. The main progression
requirements for the MSc program include successful completion of Advisory Committee
meetings and Low-Level exams. The application was implemented over 3 servers: a web, an application and a database server.
The web service is only responsible for establishing an SSL HTTP connection with a client and expose the application service.  
Additionally, the web server is based on a Representational State Transfer (REST) that provides additional security at the application level in terms of authentication and authorization. 
The technology is based on the Perl server stack, which makes the application high level and abstract. The abstraction in the application code
allows quick modifications to be done, allowing the application to be re-deployed for various other educational software problems. 
After receiving very positive feedback from the client, we are considering taking on this project full
time after graduation and implement this system within the Department of Medical Biophysics
with a possibility to expand to other faculties at Western. Overall, we are very excited about this
initiative and are looking forward to enhance the graduate student experience within various
faculties at Western.

\section{Introduction}
The SIMS core is a secure application that aims to be flexible to handle business rules of varying graduate
student programs. In the scope of this project however, focus will be placed on the Graduate Student
Program for BioMedical Physics Program at University of Western Ontario. At the very least SIMS
will hold graduate student, funding and advisory meeting data. Additionally SIMS will allow the program
administrator to organize collected data into reports and to send automatic request for data to students.
Also advisors and other faculty users will be able to see student data, progress and any advisory meetings
they have attended. SIMS will also place an emphasis on providing security of student personal data and
faculty identifications. Overall SIMS, will be replacing the current manual system of tracking students and
their progress through graduate programs.
Figure \ref{fig:New_Sys} shows the overview of the required system. The user will access the system via the Client and
Tablet devices. The data from the tablet will be processed in the client and sent via the TCP/IP protocol
to the Application Server (AppServer). The responsibility of the AppServer is to provide secure access, and
host the application. The AppServer will communicate with the Services Server to add triggers and use the
database. The AppServer and the ServicesServer will be located on a local network which is accessed via
a Virtual Private Network (VPN). Figure 3 models the users of the SIMS system. The user groups can be
broken down into 3 categories, the Student, the Faculty and the Technical Administrator. The technical
administrator will have access only to the authentication data. While the student and the faculty will have
access only to the tracked data. Additionally the faculty will have more access over the student. The role
and operations requirements will be covered more in-depth in the system features.

\section{Software Requirements Specification}

\subsection{Product perspective}
The product will be self contained as it is responsible for the User Interface, Application and Data Storage.
Figure \ref{fig:New_Sys} again describes the perspective of the system.
The product will have the following constraints:
\begin{itemize}
\item User Interface: The specifications of each view of the user interface will be provided for this project.
\item Hardware Interface: The system will be using a Wacom tablet as a hardware to acquire signatures.
\item Software interfaces: The system will have to employ several software interfaces.
\begin{itemize}
\item Application Server: Apache 2.0 will be used to deploy the system with SSL security.
\item VPN Provider: OpenVPN will be used to deploy the system as a self contained virtual private
network.
\item Database Software: A PostgreSQL RDBMS server will be used to run the Data Storage Component of the Software.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Product Function}
\subsection{User Characteristics}
Figure \ref{fig:users} describes the relation between the users of the systems, for further clarification:
\begin{itemize}
\item General User: Any user of the system, can login into the system 
\begin{itemize}
\item Faculty: Members of the faculty that can see data of several students who are not student themselves
\begin{itemize}
\item Graduate Administrator: Essentially the super user of the system, can access and modify all data 
\item Advisory Committee Member: Can view attached student data and advisory meeting documents
\item Graduate Faculty Executives: Can view all student data and view publish reports 	
\end{itemize}
\item Technical Administrator: A user that cannot access any data but can manage users 
\item Graduate Student: A student that can only view their own information and update it
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\includegraphics[scale=0.40]{diagrams/use_cases/UserHeirachy_uc.png}
\caption{Users of the System}
\label{fig:users}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Constraints}

\subsubsection{Technical Environment}
SIMS will be built on the Linux Server platform for the Database and Application Server. The client will be limited to a Linux Operating System with the Firefox 3.6 web browser.  
\subsubsection{Security}
UWO has strict guidelines (FIPPA) to handling signatures and student data. For this purpose proven technologies will be used, such as HTTP secure and VPN.
\subsubsection{Reliability of Data}
Data in SIMS is critical and needs to be protected from data losses. A regular backup of the database will help to accomplish this. 

\subsection{Assumptions and dependencies}
\subsubsection{Student Data v.s User Data}
Student Data is separate from the system, and will not be removed from the system after they graduate. However a user can still be expired from the system. Since archival is needed for a period of atleast 7 years SIMS will need to separate user access and student data. 
\subsubsection{Intrinsic Student Data}
Another assumption required by SIMS's requirement is that Student can only be stored in the system if they have a funded term attached to them. This implies that funding is tied on a term basis, which can help to simply futher calculations. 

\section{Specific Requirements}
\subsection{External interface requirements}
\subsubsection{Graphical User Interface}
A set of graphical user interfaces defined in HTML will be provided for the system to template. SIMS will show the interfaces as is and add dynamic data to them. 
\subsubsection{Hardware Interface}
SIMS will acquire signatures from client side wacom tablets from a USB 2.0 protocol. Data will be outputted in a BMP file format.

\chapter{Design}
\section{Iteration 1}

The first iteration focused on completing the analysis of the user use cases, understanding the data flow of the system. Finally based on the analysis a MVC architecture was designed and implementation. The implementation focused on :

\begin{itemize}
\item Student Data Representation 
\item Framework to display HTML templates
\item Authentication Data Representation 
\end{itemize}

\section{Analysis}
