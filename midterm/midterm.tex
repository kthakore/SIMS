\section{Specific requirements}
\subsection{External interface requirements}
\subsubsection{User interfaces}
\subsubsection{Hardware interfaces}
\subsubsection{Software interfaces}
\subsubsection{Communications interfaces}
\subsection{System features}
\subsubsection{Graphical User Interface}
\begin{enumerate}
\item purpose: provide a dossier format interface for users to see all relevant data of the student.
\item response sequence: user will login, and be able to search a student or go through a table of all available users. selecting a student will bring the user onto this interface.
\item associated functional requirements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item drill down: functional requirement 1
\begin{enumerate}
\item sections: each student will have multiple sections that can be disabled or enabled.
\item expansion: sections will expand to show summary of addition information.
\item link: sections will link to sections pages for more detailed information.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Term Calculations}
\begin{enumerate}
\item purpose: Calculate dates and event times for graduate student programs 
\item response sequence: When a student profile and program is created the system will make triggers for relevant events to each milestone
\item associated functional requirements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Milestones: functional requirement 1
\begin{enumerate}
\item Calculate ending Semesters for Graduate Students
\item Calculate due dates and triggers for milestones
\end{enumerate}
\item Funding Calculations: functional requirement 2
\begin{enumerate}
\item Track funding availibility for each semester
\item Show next date for major funding applications
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Tracking}
\begin{enumerate}
\item purpose: Track Major Milestones (grants, publications, exams etc) for graduate students through the program.
\item response sequence: Data is update according to business rules and workflow of the program and the student's progress.
\item associated functional requirements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Publications and Grants: functional requirement 1
\begin{enumerate}
			\item Track student publications that have been published 
			\item Track grants that have been recieved by the student
\end{enumerate}
\item Advisory Committee Members: functional requirement 2
\begin{enumerate}
			\item Send trigger to student to form an Advisory Committee
			\item Allow students, and advisory committees to store and track comments and discussions
			\item Show calendar view of all meetings and results of the meetings
			\item Allow for single, coperative, or joint supervisors 
			\item Track electronic submissions of advisory meeting form
\end{enumerate}
\item Manage Milestones: functional requirement 3
\begin{enumerate}
    \item handle and process milestones for the Masters program in BioMedical Physics at UWO
    \begin{enumerate}
			\item Form advisory committee by end of 1st term
			\item Annual seminars 
			\item Low-level exams for new students
			\begin{enumerate}
			\item Organized by department
			\item Exam usually in late June; informed in early May
			\end{enumerate}
			\item Possible MSc to PhD reclassification
			\begin{enumerate}
			\item Discuss with supervisor and advisory committee first
			\item Reclassification must be completed before end of 5th semester
			\end{enumerate}
			\item Submit and defend MSc thesis if not reclassified
			\begin{enumerate}
			\item http://www.uwo.ca/biophysics/grad\_program\_policies/guidelines\_intro.htm
			\end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
\item Send Triggers and Recieve Responses: functional requirement 4
\begin{enumerate}
\item Process conditional and requested triggers
\item Allow Faculty Advisor to create and view all triggers
\item Conditional triggers are event based automatic or triggered conditions
\item Requested Triggers are created by users and their activities on the system
\item The system should allow responses to each Triggers be collected and stored
\item Responses should be accessible by relevant users only 
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
