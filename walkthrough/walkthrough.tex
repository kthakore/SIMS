% Since this a solution template for a generic talk, very little can
% be said about how it should be structured. However, the talk length
% of between 15min and 45min and the theme suggest that you stick to
% the following rules:  

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection[Project Details]{Project Details}
\begin{frame}{Project Inception}
% - A title should summarize the slide in an understandable fashion
%   for anyone how does not follow everything on the slide itself.

\begin{itemize}
\item
Advisor: Dr. Hanif Ladak
\item
Concerned with managing students in the graduate program for BioMedical Physics.
\item 
Current system has lots of problems.
\begin{itemize}
\item 
Calculations and updates are mostly manual.
\item
Need to keep the paper copies of meetings.
\item 
Takes lots of time to create reports.
\item 
Hard to track when a student must have a requirement done.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Project Organization}

Two components of the problem:
\begin{itemize}
\item
(ECE4416) Business rules:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Graduate program milestones and dataflow.
\item
Direct interaction with the User.
\end{itemize}
\item 
(SE4450) Technical requirements:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Provide the functionality for the User Interfaces.
\item 
Adhere to required constraints.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Technical Requirements}

\begin{frame}{Interfaces}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
Graphical User Interface:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
The implementation of the Business Rules defined as HTML pages. 
\end{itemize}
\item 
Electrical User Interface:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item 
	Collect signatures from a Wacom \copyright Tablet and store securely in the DataBase.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Graphical User Interface}
Specific requirements for the view of the Web Pages:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
Set of HTML pages that are to be the template of the system.
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=180px]{ht/LogIn.png} \caption{ Sample GUI provided }
\end{figure}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Electrical Device Interface}
\begin{itemize}
\item
Provide an interface for the User to sign on the screen.
\item
On the client side acquire a bitmap of the signature and encrypt the bitmap data.
\item 
The image should be viewable only by the user who signed and the graduate admin.

\section*{Summary}

\begin{frame}{Summary}

% Keep the summary *very short*.
\begin{itemize}
\item
Requirements and Analysis has received direct user feedback.
\item
Architecture based of the Analysis has been clarified and prototyped. 
\item 
The iterative Software Life Cycle has produced useful work quickly and with less effort.
\item
A strong emphasis on 3 testing levels is present from the starting.
\end{itemize}
