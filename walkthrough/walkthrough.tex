% Since this a solution template for a generic talk, very little can
% be said about how it should be structured. However, the talk length
% of between 15min and 45min and the theme suggest that you stick to
% the following rules:  

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}{Project Inception}
% - A title should summarize the slide in an understandable fashion
%   for anyone how does not follow everything on the slide itself.

\begin{itemize}
\item
Advisor: Dr. Hanif Ladak
\item
Concerned with managing students in the BioMedical Physics Graduate Student at UWO.
\item 
Current system have the following problem:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
Calculations and updates can only be done by one person
\item
Need to keep the paper copies of meetings
\item 
Takes lots of time to create reports
\item 
Hard to track when a student must have a requirement done
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Current System}
Demo of the Current System.
\begin{itemize}
\item Benefits: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Faster, less error prone way of tracking graduate program
\item Possibility of expanding to other department
\item Credibility to the graduate program 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Project Organization}

Two components of the project:
\begin{itemize}
\item
(ECE4416) Business rules:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Graduate program milestones
\item
Interface requirements with the user 
\end{itemize}
\item 
(SE4450) Technical requirements:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Provide the functionality for the User Interfaces.
\item 
Adhere to required constraints.
\item 
Make a pilot for these Business Requirements with expansion in mind. 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Requirements}

\subsection{Technical Requirements}

\begin{frame}{System Roles}
\begin{figure}[!h]
\includegraphics[width=207px]{diagrams/use_cases/UserHeirachy_uc} \caption{ Roles of the SIMS system } \label{fig:Users}
\end{figure}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Interfaces}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
Graphical User Interface:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
The implementation of the Business Rules defined as HTML pages. 
\end{itemize}
\item 
Electrical User Interface:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item 
	Collect signatures from a Wacom \copyright Tablet and store securely in the DataBase.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Graphical User Interface}
Specific requirements for the view of the Web Pages:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
Set of HTML pages that are to be the template of the system.
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=180px]{images/ht/LogIn.png} \caption{ Sample GUI provided }
\end{figure}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Electrical Device Interface}
\begin{itemize}
\item
Provide an interface for the User to sign on the screen.
\item
On the client side acquire a bitmap of the signature and encrypt the bitmap data.
\item 
The image should be viewable only by the user who signed and the graduate admin.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{System Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item
User Administration
\item
Tracking Data
\begin{itemize}
\item
Student Data
\item
Student Term and Funding Data
\item 
Student Program Data
\item 
Student Advisory Committee Meeting 
\end{itemize}
\item 
Reporting
\begin{itemize}
\item
Customized Queries
\item 
Student Output Reports
\end{itemize}
\item
Triggering System 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Constraints}

\section{Architectural Analysis}

\subsection{Analysis}
\begin{frame}{Organizing Data}
\begin{itemize}
\item
Separate Authentication Data from Critical Data
\begin{figure}[!h]
\includegraphics[width=206px]{diagrams/use_cases/seperation_of_data_uc.png} \caption{ 3 general data use cases } \label{fig:Users}
\end{figure}

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Conceptual Model of the Student}
\begin{itemize}
\item
Student can be treated as a ticket, which needs to go through steps to be completed.
\begin{figure}[!h]
\includegraphics[width=319px]{diagrams/state_chart/student_ticket.png} \caption{ The simple steps of Grad School } \label{fig:Users}
\end{figure}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Critical Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Separation of Data
\begin{itemize}
\item
Student Data is kept around even after student has graduated.
\end{itemize}
\item Student as a Bug Ticket
\begin{itemize}
\item
Student will be responsible for their own data.
\item
Student can only be a student if they have a funded term.
\end{itemize}
\item
Data entry will be done manually at this point.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Architecture}
\begin{frame}{Hardware}
\begin{itemize}
\item Clients
\item Application Server
\item Services Server
\begin{figure}[!h]

\section{Iterative Design}

\subsection{Iteration 1}
\begin{frame}{Rapid Prototyping}
\begin{itemize}
\item Perl Framework
\begin{itemize}
\item A glue that abstracts the database, and templates the view
\item Controllers are defined as routes
\item Representational State Transfer (REST)
\end{itemize}
\item Database Schema
\begin{itemize}
\item Intrinsic Student Data
\item Role Based Authentication
\end{itemize}
\item E-Signature client
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section*{Summary}

\begin{frame}{Summary}

% Keep the summary *very short*.
\begin{itemize}
\item
Requirements and Analysis has received direct user feedback.
\item
Architecture based of the Analysis has been clarified and prototyped. 
\item 
The iterative Software Life Cycle has produced useful work quickly and with less effort.
\item
An emphasis on testing levels is present from the starting.
