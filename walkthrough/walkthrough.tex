% Since this a solution template for a generic talk, very little can
% be said about how it should be structured. However, the talk length
% of between 15min and 45min and the theme suggest that you stick to
% the following rules:  

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection[Project Details]{Project Details}
\begin{frame}{Project Inception}
% - A title should summarize the slide in an understandable fashion
%   for anyone how does not follow everything on the slide itself.

\begin{itemize}
\item
Advisor: Dr. Hanif Ladak
\item
Concerned with managing students in the graduate program for BioMedical Physics.
\item 
Current system has lots of problems.
\begin{itemize}
\item 
Calculations and updates are mostly manual.
\item
Need to keep the paper copies of meetings.
\item 
Takes lots of time to create reports.
\item 
Hard to track when a student must have a requirement done.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Current System}
Demo of the Current System.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Project Organization}

Two components of the problem:
\begin{itemize}
\item
(ECE4416) Business rules:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Graduate program milestones and dataflow.
\item
Direct interaction with the User.
\end{itemize}
\item 
(SE4450) Technical requirements:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Provide the functionality for the User Interfaces.
\item 
Adhere to required constraints.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Requirements}

\subsection{Technical Requirements}

\begin{frame}{Interfaces}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
Graphical User Interface:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
The implementation of the Business Rules defined as HTML pages. 
\end{itemize}
\item 
Electrical User Interface:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item 
	Collect signatures from a Wacom \copyright Tablet and store securely in the DataBase.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Graphical User Interface}
Specific requirements for the view of the Web Pages:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
Set of HTML pages that are to be the template of the system.
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=180px]{images/ht/LogIn.png} \caption{ Sample GUI provided }
\end{figure}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Electrical Device Interface}
\begin{itemize}
\item
Provide an interface for the User to sign on the screen.
\item
On the client side acquire a bitmap of the signature and encrypt the bitmap data.
\item 
The image should be viewable only by the user who signed and the graduate admin.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Architectural Analysis}

\subsection{Analysis}
\begin{frame}{Organizing Data}
\begin{itemize}
\item
Seperate Authentication Data from Critical Data
\begin{figure}[!h]
\includegraphics[width=206px]{diagrams/use_cases/seperation_of_data_uc.png} \caption{ 3 general data use cases } \label{fig:Users}
\end{figure}

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Conceptual Model of the Student}
\begin{itemize}
\item
Student can be treated as a ticket, which needs to go through steps to be completed.
\begin{figure}[!h]
\includegraphics[width=319px]{diagrams/state_chart/student_ticket.png} \caption{ The simple steps of Grad School } \label{fig:Users}
\end{figure}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Critical Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Seperation of Data
\begin{itemize}
\item
Student Data is kept around even after student has graduated.
\end{itemize}
\item Student as a Bug Ticket
\begin{itemize}
\item
Student will be responsible for their own data.
\item
Student can only be a student if they have a funded term.
\end{itemize}
\item
Data entry will be done manually at this point.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
